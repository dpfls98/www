								<p>Harry Potter, the child who lost his parents to the evil wizard Voldemort long ago, but he downed and survived,
									 does not know that he is a wizard and grows up in the Dursley family, a relative. While he was having a
									  difficult day with harsh criticism from his relatives, at the age of 11, Harry received a notice of admission
									   to Hogwarts, a magical school. Uncle Vernon Dursley prevents Harry from receiving the letter, but Harry finds
									    out that he is a wizard after many twists and turns. And with the guidance of Rubius Hagrid, the Hogwarts
										 forest keeper, who came to meet him, he prepares to enter Hogwarts and finally goes to school...

									In the wake of Cedric Diggory's death and Lord Voldemort's return, Harry Potter is worried that things could get worse. As he and his cousin Dudley are walking home from the park (following Dudley's antagonising Harry in front of his friends), they are attacked by Dementors (secretly sent by Dolores Umbridge) and Harry casts a Patronus Charm to save them both from the Dementor's Kiss. An extremely baffled Dudley is taken back to Privet Drive accompanied by Mrs Figg, a squib who is a neighbour of Harry and was told by Dumbledore to keep an eye on him.

								<p>Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and Wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defences and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts.

But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as Voldemort's followers look for Harry with orders to bring him to the Dark Lord…alive.
